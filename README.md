# Raisins

Raisins is a WYSIWYG visual editor for HTML and [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). It is inspired by
[GrapesJS](https://grapesjs.com/). It forgoes state management in Backbone in favor of [Jotai](https://jotai.org/). It uses an immutable HTML core instead of mutable DOM elements.

> Raisins: kind of like grapes, but more DRY
