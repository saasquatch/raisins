# Contributing

- The packages are linked with NPM workspaces and released with changesets.

## Getting Started

- Checkout the repo
- Install `npm i`
- Build the packages you need `npm run build`
- Run a subproject, e.g. `cd packages/react-example && npm run start`

## Publishing

- Deploys are done manually for each package with independent versioning.
